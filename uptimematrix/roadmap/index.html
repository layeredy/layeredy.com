                    <p>UptimeMatrix is now in early access for a select group of invite-only users, and we're continuing to test and build as we move forward. We're on track for our planned release in Q2 2025. If you're interested in trying UptimeMatrix, keep an eye on our news site (news.layeredy.com) for updates on when we might be looking for additional testers!</p>

                    <p>Development has been going great so far and we're on track to finish even before our current goals. We now plan to release to select users in the next 2 months (by mid-October) and to the public in Q2 2025. We have decided on a name as of August 16th, we will be releasing the name and logo on September 1st.</p>

                    <p>We have been planning and experimenting with an uptime monitoring software for around 2 years now and have decided to act on that now. <strong>We now have plans to release a uptime monitoring software by Q4 2025.</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>We have already started development on this but the name will not be released until Q1 2025.</strong> We have dedicated most of our product development team to this and <strong>are currently on track to meet our goal.</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>While we have not released anything yet we will be posting screenshots periodically on here</strong>, but check out our open source status page. This is updated regularly but will not have as many features as our SaaS version.</p>

                    <p><strong>As mentioned earlier in this post, we expect to release in Q4 2025, but we also plan to release early access to certain trusted users in Q2, and public testing in Q3.</strong> We started development on May 1st, 2024 as a side project but now are working (mostly) fully on it.</p>
                    <p><strong>Note:</strong> our fiscal calendar starts on January 1st</p>
